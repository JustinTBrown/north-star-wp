	Just as we would face-to-face, we engage in a discussion, only we’ll be online. I introduce myself, then you tell me a bit about yourself and your issue, and within 2 business days I respond with some ideas, thoughts and options/suggestions on how you can choose move forward.
</p>
<p>
	Just like emailing a friend back and forth.
</p>
<p>
	We’ll carry on our online discussion as long as needed.
</p>
<p>
	What if you develop a crisis and need immediate assistance
	while working with me? Send me an email marked urgent. I
	check my emails several times a day. However, any serious
	life threatening thoughts to yourself or others should be
	addressed immediately by calling your local crisis line or 9-1-1.
